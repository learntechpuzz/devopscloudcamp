8,1,SARAVANAN N,"It was a nice experience learning AWS. Initially i have no knowledge of Cloud and felt it would be difficult to learn - But you made the concepts simple and eay to understand. Thanks for your mentoring and have a good time ahead. One small Sugesstion - For the people looking for Certification exam, if the syllabus includes atleast 30 mins a week to go through some top scenarios (questions) and discuss on how to approach the questions and tips to pick the right answer (like elimination technique) will help to understand on what can we expect from the exam. On every module completion, if this can be planned - that would be helpful"
